# Simple card game app built with Expo Router

I want to create a simple app for mobile devices that allows you to swipe through cards with questions. It should be
possible to play with multiple players (multiplayer support).

The cards will be generated from a list of questions. The questions will be fetched from an API or generated with
OpenAI.

Also, I want to try out the new [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router) package.

## ‚úèÔ∏è ToDo
